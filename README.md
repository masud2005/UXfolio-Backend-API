# üöÄ UXfolio-Backend-API: Designer Portfolio API

## üìù Project Overview

This project provides a robust and secure Backend API for a modern UX/UI Designer Portfolio website. It is built on **Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript**, utilizing **MongoDB (Mongoose)** for reference-based data modeling and **JWT-based Authentication** with strict **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for Admin and Customer roles.

---

## üéØ Key Features & Objectives

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Strict separation of privileges for two user types:
    * **Admin:** Full CRUD control over Designs, Categories, Pricing Plans, and access to all Reviews and Purchase Orders.
    * **Customer:** Allowed to view designs, purchase, submit reviews, and manage their own profile/history.
* **Authentication & Security:** Secure JWT authentication is implemented, and **bcrypt** is used for hashing and salting user passwords.
* **Data Modeling:** Implements a **Reference-Based** MongoDB design across 6 core models: **User, Design, Category, PricingPlan, Review, and Purchase**.
* **Input Validation:** Strong request data validation is enforced using **Zod** schemas.

## üåê API Endpoints & Authorization Details

All API routes are prefixed with `/api/`. Access is strictly controlled by the `checkAuth` middleware based on the user's role (Admin, Customer, or Public).
